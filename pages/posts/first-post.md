I have to confess that I never imagined working 
with Next.js and Vercel would be this awesome, so let
me tell you all about it.

### The tutorial
The starter steps of the website was 
interesting and carefully laid out; I got
everything with ease. The platform also tries
to engage you to learn more with its points system.

### The framework itself
The framework is relatively simple and written in almost
self-explanatory form; you could see what each component does
and why it's there. Also, forget to mention, it is superfast;
no need to refresh.

### The Platform
If this framework was run by some self-centered, unfriendly
people, I wouldn't even have wanted to use it, ever, and would 
prefer anything over it, even vanilla javascript. That's why I'm 
glad to discover the people behind this framework, Vercel. Not
only the platform is so engaging to use, but also they have features
I have been dying hard to find them all in one bundle.
Namely: Deploy with GitHub, templates, free, auto SSL certificates,
Domain name and subdomain management, and serverless functions.
In addition, I think they are highly generous of their free plans.
Of course, that is if your website is not for commercial purposes.
